      question: "What incomes are charged to tax under the head 'Capital Gains'?",
      answer: `Income that arises from selling a capital asset is known as capital gains. A capital asset includes any type of property that an assessee holds for any purpose. 
Capital assets are taxable in the year of transfer and can be short-term or long-term. Examples include:
- Land
- Building
- House property
- Patents
- Trademarks`

     {
      question: "What is the meaning of capital assest?",
      answer: `Capital assets are significant pieces of property like investments, stocks, bonds, homes, cars, and art collectibles. Capital assets generally have a useful life of more than one year and are not intended for sale in the due course of a business. For example, a car purchased for the purpose of reselling and not for use will be considered an inventory. However, a car purchased by a individual or a business for the purpose of use in the business is considered a capital asset.

Section 2(14) of the IT Act 1961 defines the capital asset as -

- Any kind of property held by the assessee, whether related to his/her business or not.
- Securities held by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) -who have invested in securities as specified by the SEBI Act, 1992.
- Any Unit Linked Insurance Policy (ULIP) that is not covered under the exemptions on clause 10D of section 10

Capital assets do not include the following -

-Any stock in trade except securities specified in sub-clause (b), raw materials, or consumable stores held for a business profession.
-Personal assets held by an individual for his/her use or for the use of dependants. However, assets like jewelry, drawings, paintings, sculptures, artwork, and archaeological collections`

     {
      question: "What is the meaning of the term 'long-term capital asset'?",
      answer: `A long-term capital asset is an asset held for more than 36 months before the date it is transferred. However, an asset is known as a capital asset even when it is held for more than 12 months in the following cases -

  - Equity shares or preference shares that are listed on a recognized Indian stock exchange.
  - Other securities listed on the Indian Stock Exchange
  - Units of UTI
  - Units of an equity-oriented fund
  - Zero coupon bond
  - Unlisted preference shares or equity shares held in a company (if these shares were transferred on or before 10th July 2014.
  - Mutual fund units as specified under section 10(23D), except the equity-oriented fund.
Any asset that is held for less than or exactly for 36 months or 12 months is termed a short-term capital asset and is charged to tax at a different rate`
    },
     {
      question: "Why are capital gains classified as short-term and long-term?",
      answer: `The holding period of the asset defines its taxability. Whether you have to pay tax on a capital gain depends on how long you have held the asset. The tax rates on short-term and long-term capital gains also differ from each other. Therefore, capital assets are classified as short-term and long-term.

The sale of assets held for a period longer than 1 year and fixed assets held for a period longer than 3 years are chargeable to tax as long-term capital gains. The tax rates on long-term capital gains can be 0%, 15%, or 20% of the taxable income.

Short-term capital gains are the gains that arise from the sale of short-term capital assets that are held for a period of less than 1 year or 3 years, depending on the nature of the asset. The tax rates on STCGs are usually higher than that on long-term capital gains.`
    },
     {
      question: "What is long-term capital gain and short-term capital gain?",
      answer: `Any capital gain that arises from the sale of a long-term capital asset is known as a long-term capital gain. The classification of assets as short-term or long-term is done on the basis of the period of holding. The benefit of indexation is also available on a long-term capital gain. The indexation benefit increases the asset's acquisition cost, thereby reducing the profit and tax.

Short-term capital gain is the gain that arises from the sale of short-term capital assets. Short-term capital gains are also classified on the basis of their holding period and the type of the asset. If you have a short-term capital gain, you cannot avail yourself of the benefit of indexation. Also, the tax rates on short-term capital gains on equity mutual funds are higher than that on long-term capital gains. You can calculate the indexed cost of acquisition using an indexed cost calculator.`
    },
     {
      question: "How to compute long-term capital gain?",
      answer: `Long-term capital gains arise when the owner of an asset sells it at a profit after holding it for 1 year (in the case of shares and securities) and before 3 years (in the case of assets like land, buildings, etc.).

The computation of long-term capital gains is performed as below -

Long-term capital gain = Sale Price - (indexed cost of acquisition + indexed cost of improvement + transfer cost)

Indexed cost of acquisition = cost of acquisition x cost of inflation index of the year when the asset was transferred or acquired.
Indexed cost of improvement = cost of improvement x the cost inflation index of the year in which the asset was transferred or the cost inflation index of the year of improvement.
The gain thus derived is taxed at the rates applicable based on the tax bracket and the type of asset.`
    },
     {
      question: "How to compute short-term capital gain?",
      answer: `A short-term capital gain arises when a capital asset held for less than 1 year and 3 years is sold at a profit thereafter.

Short-term capital gains on shares are computed as follows -

Suppose you bought 100 shares of X Ltd. at Rs.100 each and sold at Rs. 120 after holding for 6 months. Then,

STCG = Sale Price - Purchase price = Rs.120x100 - Rs.100x100 = Rs.2000

The sale price is computed as -
Sale value of an asset - (brokerage charges + securities transaction tax)

Short-term capital gains on assets are computed as follows -

STCG = sale value of the asset - (cost of acquisition + expenses incurred while transfer + cost of asset improvement)

Cost of acquisition - For a short-term asset purchased before 1st Feb 2018, it is calculated as follows -

- The fair market value of assets is calculated by multiplying the number of shares with the highest share price on 31st Jan 2018.
- The fair market value is then compared with the actual sale value of the shares, and the lower between the two is selected.
- The resultant figure is compared with the actual purchase value, and the higher between the two is chosen.
Cost of improvement refers to the expenses incurred on improving the asset. It includes constriction, expansion, or repair of an asset. However, this does not apply in the case of equity shares.`
    },
     {
      question: "Is the benefit of indexation available while computing capital gain arising on the transfer of short-term capital assets?",
      answer: `No, the benefit of indexation is not available on the capital gain arising from transferring of short-term capital assets.

Indexation refers to the process that is used to adjust the purchase price of the asset according to the rate of inflation in the economy. The inflation rate between the year of purchase and the year of sale is taken into account to determine the real gain and impose tax only on the real profit. Indexation reduces the overall purchase price. This leads to a reduction in the amount of profit and, thus, the tax.

Since the holding period of short-term capital gains is less, the price of short-term capital assets is not affected much by the inflation rate prevailing in the economy. Therefore, the benefit of indexation is not available for short-term capital gains.`
    },
     {
      question: "In respect of capital assests acquired before the  1st April 2001, is there any special method to compute the cost of acquisition?",
      answer: `If the property is acquired before 1st April 2001 by the assessee, the cost of acquisition of the asset is calculated as follows -

The assessee can consider any of the below options as the cost of acquisition -

- The asset's fair market value as of April 1st, 2001
- The asset's actual cost of acquisition.
- The assessee can choose any of the above options as the cost of acquisition. If the option is available, the higher of the two is considered the cost of acquisition.
- If the asset is of depreciable nature, this option is not available.
- This option is also not available if the capital asset is a goodwill or trademark.
* Fair market value or FMV is the price at which an asset would ordinarily sell at a given date in the open market.`

     {
      question: "If any undisclosed income[in the form of investment in capital asset] is declared under Income Declaration Scheme, 2016, then what should be the cost of acquisition of such capital asset?",
      answer: `Income Declaration Scheme 2016 does not provide specific provisions for the cost of acquisition. However, the basic objective of the Income Declaration Scheme is to allow individuals to disclose their undisclosed income and pay tax on it to avoid any kind of penalty in the future.

The cost of acquisition or any other consideration paid for acquiring the asset is irrelevant to IDS. Therefore, the fair market value of the asset is considered to be its cost of acquisition. The cost of acquisition represents the price that the asset would sell at in an open market.

Therefore, the cost of acquisition while declaring an undisclosed asset under the Income Declaration Scheme of 2016 is the fair market value of the asset.`

      question: "As per the Income-tax Law, the gain arising on the transfer of the capital asset is charged to tax under the head'Capital gains.' What constitutes 'transfer' as per Income-tax Law?",

- The sale or exchange of the asset
- Extinguishment of rights
- A compulsory acquisition under any law

     {
      question: "At what rates capital gains are charged to tax?",
      answer: `On selling equity shares or equity-oriented mutual funds after holding them for more than a year, taxpayers have to pay long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) on the profit. The LTCG tax rate is 10% for gains exceeding ₹ 1 lakh in a financial year. However, for other types of investments, such as unlisted securities or zero-coupon bonds, the LTCG tax rate is 20%. If equity shares or equity-oriented mutual funds are sold within one year, taxpayers have to pay short-term capital (STCG) on the profits. The STCG tax rate depends on whether the securities transaction tax (STT) is applicable or not. If STT is applicable, the STCG tax rate is 15%. If STT is not applicable, the STCG tax rate will be applied as per the income tax slab the assessee falls under.`

      question: "Is there any benefit available in respect of re-investment of capital gain in any other asset?",
      answer: `There are tax benefits on capital gains by reinvesting them in other assets as per the Income Tax Act 1961.

Section 54EC: You can reinvest long-term capital gains from any asset except a house in bonds of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) or the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC). The amount of capital gains that can be reinvested under this section is limited to the capital gains arising from the asset's sale or ₹50 lakhs, whichever is lower.

Section 54F: Any individual or HUF can reinvest LTCG from any asset other than a residential house property to a new residential house (Limited to One) in India. The amount of capital gains that can be reinvested under this section is limited to the capital gains arising from the asset's sale, but it is capped at ₹10 crores.

Reinvestment should happen within six months U/S 54EC and within one year U/S 54F. Investing in certain assets like infrastructure or renewable energy may have other tax benefits.`

      question: "Are there any bonds in which I can invest my capital gains to claim tax relief?",
      answer: `There are some bonds in which an individual can invest capital gains to claim tax relief. These bonds are known as capital gains bonds or Section 54EC bonds.

Capital gains bonds are issued by government-owned companies such as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), and the Power Finance Corporation (PFC). These bonds offer a fixed interest rate and a maturity period of 5 years.

To claim tax benefits on capital gains bonds, you must reinvest the capital gains from selling a capital asset, such as a house or land, in these bonds within 6 months of the sale. The maximum amount of capital gains an individual can reinvest in capital gains bonds is ₹50 Lakh.`

      question: "What is the meaning of stamp duty value and what is its relevance while computing capital gain in case of tranfer of capital asset, being land or building or both?",
      answer: `The stamp duty value is the price used to calculate stamp duty; it's a tax levied on the sale of property. U/S 50c of the Income Tax Act, if the actual sale consideration for a property is less than the stamp duty value, then the stamp duty value will be used to calculate capital gains. I.e., The seller will be liable to pay tax on the entire stamp duty value, even if they received a lower consideration. This might happen when the seller sells the property to the related party at a discounted price or at a loss.`

  "Form 16": [
    {
      question: "What is Form 16?",
      answer: `Form-16 is a TDS certificate that the employer issues to the employee as proof of deducting the TDS. The employer has to deduct the income tax at source from the employee and passing it on to the government authorities. In other words, Form-16 is a certificate that provides details of the tax deducted at the source and also acts as proof that the TDS has been submitted to the government. Companies calculate the tax payable by the employee on the basis of income and investment declaration he/she makes at the beginning of the year and deduct TDS on the basis of the same. This TDS is then deposited to the government and reflected in Form 16.`

    question: `What to do if the TDS credit is not reflected in Form 26AS?`,
    answer: `Sometimes, the TDS deducted by the payer is not reflected in Form 26AS. There can be various reasons for such non-reflection of TDS amount in 26AS like -

No tax will be deducted if any sum is payable to the Government, Reserve Bank of India, or a corporation established by or under a central act. This means that any payment made to these government bodies, whether it is interest, commission, rent, royalty, fees, or any other income, is exempt from TDS. This exemption is based on the rationale that the Government is the ultimate recipient of tax revenue, and hence there is no need to deduct tax from payments made to the government.`

    answer: `The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) clarified this issue in circular no.17 dated 29.9.2020. It has stated that TCS is to be collected on the sales consideration that includes GST as well. This is because TCS is not a tax on income but an interim levy on the possible income earned from the sale of goods. Therefore, it does not affect the valuation of goods or services under GST. This is also in line with the circular issued by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) in Dec 2018, which clarified that TCS is not a part of the taxable value for GST purposes.`

    question: `My employer reimburses to me all my expenses on grocery and children's education. Would these be considered as my income?`,
    answer: `Yes, any reimbursement provided by the employer to the employee for the expenses incurred is considered to be perquisite under the Indian Income Tax Law. Perquisites are additional benefits provided by the employer to the employee over and above the salary and allowances. These perquisites are taxable in the hands of employees.

While allowances are the benefit provided to meet specific expenses in monetary form, perquisites are the benefits the employer provides to the employee above the salary and allowance amount and can be given in the form of goods, services, reimbursements, etc.

Since the expenses like children's education and grocery expenses are considered perquisites under the Indian Income Tax Act, the reimbursements of the same will be taxable in the employee's hands.`

    answer: `Any ex-gratia payment received by the employer as a token of appreciation for good work or as compensation for any injury or hazard that took place while on duty or due to death on duty is not considered a part of salary and hence not taxable.

Ex gratia payment is a monetary compensation provided by an employer to the employee or the dependents of the employee (in case of death) or in case of injury or retrenchment.

    question: `Is pension income taxed as salary income?`,
    answer: `Pension is the portion set aside from an employee's salary, which is paid out periodically, usually on a monthly basis. The Taxpayer can also opt to receive his pension as a lump sum which is called commuted pension. A periodically paid pension is called uncommuted pension. The source of pension income is usually an annuity fund that the employer and the employee create during the service period. The annuity fund invests the contributions and pays out the pension to the employee after retirement.

The taxation of pension income depends on whether it is commuted or uncommuted. An uncommuted pension is taxed as salary income in the hands of the employee. Commuted pension is partially exempt from tax depending on the type of employee. Commuted or uncommuted pension is exempted from tax in case of government employment. In the case of a non-government employee, a pension is partially exempt depending on whether the employee receives the gratuity.`

PF is exempt if received from a recognized PF after completing at least 5 years of continuous service. However, if the employee has not completed 5 years of service, PF is taxable as salary income in the year of receipt. The exemption limit for Gratuity is calculated as the least of the following: 15 days' salary for each completed year of service or part thereof; actual amount received; or Rs 20 lakh. The salary for this purpose includes basic pay and dearness allowance.`

    question: `How to compute income from a property which is self-occupied for part of the year and let out for part of the year?`,
    answer: `If you own a property that you use for yourself for some part of the year and rent out for the rest of the year, you may wonder how to calculate your income from it for tax purposes. You have to treat the property as if it was rented out for the whole year and use the rent received as the basis for your income calculation. However, you can only include the actual rent you received for the period that the property was let out and not the notional rent you could have received if it was let out for the entire year. This way, you can account for the income from your property in a fair and accurate manner.`

    question: `What is the tax treatment of unrealised rent which is subsequently realised?`,
    answer: `Section 25AA of the Income Tax Act deals with the taxation of unrealised rent that is subsequently realised by the owner of a house property.

  {
    question: `Is it necessary to apply for different TAN if a deductor has to deduct tax from different types of payments like salary, interest, dividend, commission, etc.?`,
    answer: `- No, applying for different TAN is unnecessary if a deductor has to deduct tax from unique types of payments. A single TAN can be used for all types of deductions. This is because the TAN is not linked to the type of deduction but to the deductor itself.
- For example, if a company has to deduct tax from salaries, interest, dividends, and commissions, it can use the same TAN for all of these deductions. The only time that a deductor would need to apply for a separate TAN is if they were operating in different branches or divisions.
- Possessing or using more than one TAN is not legal.`

    question: `Can foreign nationals resident in India open resident account?`,
    answer: `Foreign nationals are permitted to open an ordinary savings account, as many residents in India do. In fact, even foreign tourists on a short visit to India can open an account. A foreign national who comes on a visit can open only an NRO account, while a foreign national resident in India can open a resident account as well. So, this will operate just like any other domestic account. However, one needs to be careful on the likely procedure that would be followed for repatriation. Money in the NRE account can be repatriated freely, while in the case of NRO, certain terms might need to be fulfilled. So, although Foreign nationals may be allowed to open a resident account, foreign nationals must also understand the implications and whether they are allowed to freely repatriate from a resident account or whether specific permission is needed for the purpose.`

Condition 1: Determining whether resident or non-resident

A HUF is a resident in India if it has some or all of its control and management in India.

Condition 2: Determining whether resident and ordinarily resident or resident but not ordinarily resident

A resident HUF is ordinarily resident in India if its manager (i.e., karta or manager) meets both of these conditions:

- He is resident in India for at least 2 years out of the last 10 years.

    question: `How to determine the residential status of a company?`,
    answer: `A company is a resident in India if:

- It is Indian; or
- Its key decisions are made in India.
This rule is applicable from Assessment Year 2017-18. The CBDT has issued final guidelines for the determination of the POEM of a foreign company.

The guidelines have a test of Active Business Outside India (ABOI). A company has ABOI if passive income is less than 50% of total income. It also has to meet some conditions on assets, employees, and payroll.

If a company has ABOI, its key decisions are assumed to be outside India if most board meetings are outside India.

If not, the key decision-makers and their location have to be identified.

However, According to CIRCULAR NO.8, DATED 23-2-2017, companies with annual turnover or gross receipts of INR 50 crores or less are exempt from the POEM guidelines.`
